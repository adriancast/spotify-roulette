## What is this project

This is a mini project for [Hacktober fest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com). This project will make you able to log in your spotify account and play music in your devices.

### Prerequisites

This are the needed tools:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/): JavaScript environment in server side
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/): a command line interface

For NodeJS you must download the LTS version from their official web page. Once you have installed it, you can now proceed to install Angular typing `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

### Installing

For a develop environment just download all the dependencies with `npm install`.

## Running the tests

There are no tests yet.

## Deployment

For local deployment just type `npm run start`. It will automatically open a new browser in `localhost:4200`.
In case you need to change your port, add this flag `--port <port_number>`.

## Built With

* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) - Front End Framework with a command line interface for Angular
